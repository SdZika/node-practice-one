// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. Node.js is commonly used for building scalable network applications and APIs. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a popular choice for web development, real-time applications, and microservices architecture.
